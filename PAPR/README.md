# Personal Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPRs)

PAPRs generally have the following types of components:

* **Hood** - Covers the user's entire head. Purified air is typically fed through a tube
* **Mask** - Covers the user's face. Purified air may be fed directly into the mask through a blower motor attached to the mask or through a tube.
* **Blower** - A device which pulls in air through a filter and delivers it to the user's mask or hood.
* **Filter**
* **Battery**
* **Flow meter** - to check that enough air is still able to flow through to the user. If the flow drops below a threshold, it indicates to the user that the filter must be replaced

## Assumptions

* **Hoods**, unlike masks, are consumables. There should be significantly more hoods available than the other components
* **Blower** - The nature of PAPRs is such that these are expensive and are not massproduced since only a very tiny subset of industries uses PAPRs. **It is critical that we be able to mass produce these first.**
* **Filter** - PAPRs do not share a standard when it comes to component design, therefore filters for existing PAPRs come in all different shapes and sizes. **Standardizing fittings between filters is second priority** (see **ComponentAdapters**). 
	* Sourcing filters will soon become problematic. Many HCWs are already resorting to creating their own masks with unknown protection. The **third priority** will be to produce our own filters that have been tested in a way where we have **some** idea of how well it will protect the user (see **Filters**)
* **Masks** - If we cannot source hoods (I am unsure of whether we can easily produce hoods, even if we're now sourcing the help of the garment industry), then we must be able to produce masks as a substitute.
