# PAPR Mask

## Idea
* Repurpose full face snorkel masks
* Mount a 40mm female threaded socket inplace of the breathing tube

## Questions
* Can we mount a 40mm threaded filter directly to the mask and use it as a manual respirator?

## Testing Protocol
* Seal the mask (TBD)
* Pressurize the mask to x (target pressure TBD)
* Submerge in water for y minutes (TBD)
* Observe for air leaks

	* NOTES:
		* Note the difference in exhalation valve placement. Some exit near the intake, others are separate from the inlet tube.

* Silicon adhesive to seal components airtight
