# Disinfecting Reusable Devices

## Problem
* Although some devices might survive the autoclave, many items which were intended to be disposed off after a single use are now required to be reused over and over again to prolong our dwindling supply.
* These items are probably disinfected with an alcohol or bleach solution
* Other items which are intented to be reused cannot to through the autoclave, like PAPRs 
* These are expected to be hand-disinfected. 
* Coverage of these items becomes questionable when manual disinfection is required. This is doubly so with soft devices like hoods and coveralls

## Proposal
* Use an ultrasonic humidifier/nebulizer to aerosolize the disinfectant
* Store coveralls and other loose clothing in a vinyl closet with the ultrasonic humidifier
* For hard components, store them in a large plastic box with the ultrasonic humidifier. Possibly want to use a wire rack to suspend the components to aid in maximizing coverage

## Concerns
* Will components survive being bathed in disinfectants? 
	* Metal contacts in PAPR device
	* Material used in coveralls
