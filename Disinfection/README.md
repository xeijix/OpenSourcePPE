# Disinfection and Materials

## Problem
* Different kinds of disinfectants may be used. They may degrade the materials used so we want to choose the most flexible materials wherever possible

## Materials
* Cyanoacrylate - Testing of cyanoacrylate adhesives with a number of sterilization methods has yielded varying results, depending on formulations. In general, however, Cyanoacrylate adhesives have been shown to withstand up to fifty cycles of liquid sterilization immersion as well as hydrogen peroxide. In addition, select cyanoacrylate adhesives have exhibited moderate resistance to autoclave exposure â€“ with some specialty ethyl grades maintaining nearly 100% of their initial strengths following exposure to fifty autoclave cycles. A critical factor in maintaining bond strengths with cyanoacrylate adhesives following autoclave exposure is the selection of substrates that offer moderate to high initial strengths as well as substrates capable of withstanding the rigorous temperature, pressure and steam environment of the system. 

* Materials whose chemical resistance are available: 
	* **Legend**: 
		* Grades: A,B,C,D. A is best

|Disinfectant|Silicone|Rubber|Neoprene|
|---|---|---|---|
|Bleach| D | C | D |
|Hydrogen Peroxide| B | C | D |
|Ethanol| B | A | A |
|Isopropyl| A | A | B |


## Notes
* Both H2O2 and alcohol are common disinfectants used in the medical setting. Based on that, **silicone** is probably the best material to use. Silicone can be used as an adhesive as well as a gasket material.

# Disinfecting Reusable Devices

## Problem
* Although some devices might survive the autoclave, many items which were intended to be disposed off after a single use are now required to be reused over and over again to prolong our dwindling supply.
* These items are probably disinfected with an alcohol or bleach solution
* Other items which are intented to be reused cannot to through the autoclave, like PAPRs 
* These are expected to be hand-disinfected. 
* Coverage of these items becomes questionable when manual disinfection is required. This is doubly so with soft devices like hoods and coveralls

## Proposal
* Use an ultrasonic humidifier/nebulizer to aerosolize the disinfectant
* Store coveralls and other loose clothing in a vinyl closet with the ultrasonic humidifier
* For hard components, store them in a large plastic box with the ultrasonic humidifier. Possibly want to use a wire rack to suspend the components to aid in maximizing coverage

## Concerns
* Will components survive being bathed in disinfectants? 
	* Metal contacts in PAPR device
	* Material used in coveralls
